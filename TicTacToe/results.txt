MiniMax:
    - on a 3x3 board
        - it goes up to a max ply of 8 (this is the max for Tic Tac Toe)
        - The following are the results after I placed the first move at index 0
        - 8 ply -> 59,704 possibilities checked
        - 7 ply -> 45,736 possibilities checked
        - 6 ply -> 24,424 possibilities checked
        - 5 ply ->  8,080 possibilities checked
        - 4 ply ->  2,080 possibilities checked
        - 3 ply ->    400 possibilities checked
        - 2 ply ->     64 possibilities checked
        - 1 ply ->      8 possibilities checked
        - It seems that 6 ply is the lowest it can go and still have a perfect game
    - on a 4x4 board
        - it goes up to a max depth of 15 (but too slow to make any moves)
